	<h2>About us</h2>
<p>This website is about those who are fans of Horror. It may be related to movies, games, books, etc. This website will talk about the different horror media that are to be offered to those who love this genre. This is a place of free judgment. We do not welcome those who will be here to make fun of other people's love for horror.</p>
<p>I have been a massive fan of horror since I was younger. I used to watch horror movies then a bit after I got into gaming. I then got myself into the horror section of games. The first official horror game I played was Dead Space. From there on out, I just continued to enjoy the horror genre and still love it to this day.</p>
